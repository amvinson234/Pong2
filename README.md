# Pong2

A self-learning project to learn some basic game design using SFML.

This is largely based on a useful tutorial by the website GameFromScratch. But I did not follow the tutorial to the letter, and did many things differently, while adding a variety of features. (The tutorial is also a bit dated, using SFML 1.x, where I used version 2 here.)

Pong2 is a two-player game, with player 1 using the left and right arrows to control their paddle, and player 2 using A and D to control theirs.

This is basically Pong, but where multiple balls may appear on screen, with a new ball spawning at some given frequency (depending on settings).
